A sorting algorithm is a method for reorganizing a large number of items into a specific order,such as alphabetical,highest to lowest value or shortest to longest distance.sorting algorithms take lists of items as input data,perfprms specific operations on those lists of items as input data,performs specific operations on those lists and deliver deliver ordered arrays as output.
Big o notation is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms.its calculates the time taken to run an algorithm as the input grows.Inotherwords it calculates t worst case time complexity of an algorithm.Big o notation in data structure describes the upper bound of an algorithms runtime.
